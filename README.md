# Classifying *The Stanford Daily* Headlines Using Naive Bayes

This repository contains the code and report for my CS109 Probability Challenge project, where I use a simple Naive Bayes classifier to distinguish between News and Opinion headlines from *The Stanford Daily* using only their words.

The project shows that even a 109-level probabilistic model can detect stylistic differences between sections: on a held-out set of 20 headlines (10 News, 10 Opinion), the classifier achieves 85% accuracy.
